# Bootcamp Module 3 Challenge: Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal responsive portfolio page. Built using Bootstrap (and HTML and CSS) it is meant to be a showcase of concepts learned thus far in bootcamp. This is a "work in progress" type repo, as more projects will be added as I move through the different stages of bootcamp.
